This is a repository for the simulation code use in the manuscript <Importance of timely contact tracing - A simulation study> (Mettler et al, 2021, International Journal of Infectious Diseases, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.029). 

Our simulation code is a modification of the simulation work by Prof. Silva (Silva PCL, Batista PVC, Lima HS, Alves MA, Guimar√£es FG, Silva RCP.
