This is a repository for the simulation code use in the manuscript <Diagnostic Serial Interval as an Indicator for Effectiveness of Contact Tracing in the COVID-19 Pandemic - A Simulation Study> (Mettler, 2021, currently under review). 

Our simulation code is a modification of the simulation work by Prof. Silva (Silva PCL, Batista PVC, Lima HS, Alves MA, Guimar√£es FG, Silva RCP.
